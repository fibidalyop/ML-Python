# Machine Learning Notebooks

This is a series of **machine learning algorithms** in python. It will include **Regression**, **Classification**, **Ensembles**, **Recommendation**, **NLP**, **K-Mean Clustering**, **Dimensionality Reduction**(LDA & PCA) and **Deep Learning**(ANN & CNN) algorithms.

I will be using open source datasets obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Data.gov](https://data.gov/), *etc*
